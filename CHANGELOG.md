# CHANGELOG

Version 0.2.0

## Breaking changes
- Removed notebooks (pseudonomyzation)
- Removed redundant classes `FakerSpan`, `FakerSpanResult` and updated code to use `Span` and `InputSample` respectively, changed `SentenceFaker` to inherit from Faker instead of using composition.
- Removed functions `from_faker_span`, `from_faker_spans_result` `convert_faker_spans` from `InputSample`, as faker spans are now `Span`s so there no need for translation.
- Removed `PresidioDataGenerator` to use `PresidioSentenceFaker` instead 
- Removed support for CRF models
- Removed the `FlairTrainer` class, please refer to the official Flair documentation for training Flair models
- Removed CRF as the package used is no longer maintained

## Improvements
- Improved evaluation notebooks: Notebook 4 shows a vanilla Presidio evaluation, notebook 5 shows a more customized Presidio with improved accuracy (#103)
- Removed the Pseudonomyzation notebook as there is a more advanced approach within Presidio (#103)
- Added the ability to use generic entities and skip words (#103)
- Added the ability to do faster batch predict (#103)
- Added sample_id to be able to reproduce the full sample (#103)
- Fixed issue with hospital provider networking (#103)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix translation of Input Sample tags (#88)
- Fix Presidio wrapper to call predict with a language parameter (#79)

## Other Changes
- Updates to all classes inheriting from BaseModel, as the predict signature has changed (now containing **kwargs) (#92)
- Added Poetry instead of setup.py (#91)
- Rename UsDriverLicenseProvider.driver_license to us_driver_license (#90)
- Removed redundant classes FakerSpan, FakerSpanResult and updated code to use Span and InputSample respectively instead (#72)
- Changed SentenceFaker to inherit from Faker instead of using composition (#72)
- Simplified the use of SentenceFaker in the default option (RecordGenerator is instantiated if records are passed, otherwise a SpanGenerator is instantiated) (#72)
- Updates to unit tests to support this change (#72)
- Updates to poetry to include the config in setup.cfg, setup.py, and pytest.ini (#72)
